# Simple-LAN-Setup-Project
In this project, I set up a basic Local Area Network (LAN) using an managed switch, a Wi-Fi router, and a MacBook. The goal was to establish a simple network where multiple devices could communicate with each other and access the internet via a shared gateway.
Tools & Equipment Used:

	•	Wi-Fi Router (providing internet connection and default gateway)
	•	8-Port Managed Switch (for connecting devices to the network)
	•	Ethernet Cable (for wired connections between devices)
	•	MacBook (used as one of the connected devices)

Project Steps:

	1.	Connecting the Wi-Fi Router to the Managed Switch:
	•	Ran an Ethernet cable from the Wi-Fi router to the unmanaged switch to provide internet access and allow other devices to connect to the network.
	2.	Connecting the MacBook to the Managed Switch:
	•	Connected my MacBook to the unmanaged switch using an Ethernet cable. The MacBook received a unique IP address while sharing the same default gateway (the router’s IP address).
	3.	Network Setup:
	•	The router assigned an IP address to the MacBook through DHCP, ensuring it could communicate with the router and other devices on the network.
	•	The default gateway is the router’s IP address, which allows the MacBook to access the internet and devices within the same network.
	4.	Verifying Connectivity:
	•	Pinged the router’s IP address from the MacBook to ensure the connection was working properly.
	•	Ensured that the MacBook had access to the internet and was able to communicate with the router.

Results:

	•	Successfully set up a LAN with the router as the gateway, and the managed switch as the network hub for connected devices.
	•	The MacBook was able to access the internet and communicate with other devices (once added to the network).
	•	Learned the basics of IP addressing, DHCP, and LAN configurations.

Lessons Learned:
	•	Learned the basics of IP addressing, DHCP, and LAN configurations.

Conclusion:

This project provided hands-on experience with both LAN setup and the configuration options available in a managed switch. It’s an essential foundational project for understanding network management and administration. In the next steps, I plan to implement VLANs, configure static IPs, and experiment with QoS settings.
